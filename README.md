# Reckitt

In this project we will use supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms to analyze Reckitt sales data. Reckitt is a multinational company dedicated to the generation of health, hygiene and household cleaning products. Among its most prominent products are Vanish, Lysol, Harpic, Dettol, durex, among others.

The data to be analyzed come from the sales of Vanish and Lysol pre-wash, bleach, and sanitizer products, respectively. The objective of this project is to evaluate the sales performance of Vanish and Lysol products, identify key opportunities to grow the market and sales, and make sales forecasts for both brands.
